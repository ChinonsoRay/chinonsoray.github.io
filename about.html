    <div>
        <p>Currently working at Stutern for my NYSC. </div> 
    <p>I'm actually a graduate of Microbiology with no previous knowledge in development or design. I love everything that has to do with design. I'm currently enrolled in the SGA program, organized by Stutern. </p>
    <p>I previously worked with two fashion designers before starting my tech journey. During this, I had the opportunity to style a couple of celebrities and somewhat important people from all over the country (read= Lagos).</p>
    <p>My major weakness in life is COMPLACENCY. It is a disease.</p></div>
    <p>I am currently working to get to a level of expertise so I can be able to inspire younger ones who are really confused about what they want out of life.</p></div>
